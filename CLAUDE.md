# CLAUDE.md

Instructions for Claude Code when working with this codebase.

## CRITICAL: Follow Strictly

This document MUST be followed strictly. All instructions are mandatory requirements, not suggestions.

### NEVER Run Destructive Git Commands Without Permission

**ABSOLUTE RULE:** Never run `git checkout`, `git reset`, `git revert`, `git clean`, or any other destructive git command without explicit user approval, **EVEN IF PERMISSIONS ALLOW IT**.

These commands can lose hours of work. Always ask first:
- `git checkout` - can discard uncommitted changes
- `git reset` - can lose commits and changes
- `git revert` - creates new commits
- `git clean` - permanently deletes untracked files

**Note:** These should be in the "ask" list in `.claude/settings.json`, NOT in `settings.local.json`. If you see them in the allow list, something is misconfigured.

1. Read this entire document at start of each session
2. Follow TDD strictly - Write tests BEFORE implementation, no exceptions
3. Verify compliance before completing any task
4. Ask if unsure rather than making assumptions
5. Seek the BEST solution - Prioritize correctness, maintainability, quality over speed

### Core Philosophy: Best Solution, Not Fastest

Always seek the best solution, not the easiest or fastest. Choose cleaner, more maintainable code. Invest time in proper architecture. Don't cut corners. Quality and correctness are paramount; development speed is secondary.

### Parallel Task Execution

CRITICAL: Execute independent tasks in parallel whenever possible to save time and reduce iteration count.

Use parallel execution for:
- Reading multiple files with Read tool - Call all Read operations in single message
- Running multiple independent searches with Grep/Glob - Execute all searches simultaneously
- Running multiple independent Bash commands - Use multiple tool calls in one message
- Launching multiple subagents for different aspects of review - code-reviewer, security-auditor, doc-checker can all run at once

Examples:
- Instead of: Read file A, then Read file B, then Read file C (3 sequential messages)
- Do: Read files A, B, and C in single message with 3 Read tool calls (1 message)

- Instead of: grep pattern1, then grep pattern2, then grep pattern3 (3 sequential messages)
- Do: All 3 grep searches in single message (1 message)

Only execute sequentially when tasks have dependencies (e.g., must read file before editing it, must complete task A before starting task B that depends on A's results).

## After Making Changes - Run Quick Check

MANDATORY after any code changes (Dart, Kotlin, Swift), run from project root:

```bash
cd /Users/vitor/resilio/Dev/goodinside/git/pro_video_player
make format quick-check
```

IMPORTANT: Always run from project root, NOT from subdirectories.

Formats code first, then runs all checks in parallel: Dart analyze, Kotlin compile, iOS/macOS Swift compile, format check, logging verification, code duplication, and unit tests.

Do NOT consider task complete until `make format quick-check` passes. If fails: fix errors, run again, repeat until passes.

## Copyright and Legal Compliance

CRITICAL: All test fixtures, example media, assets MUST be copyright-compliant for open source distribution.

Allowed:
- Public domain content
- Open source licensed files with attribution (MIT, Apache 2.0, CC-BY-SA)
- W3C specification examples
- Simple non-creative test data
- Self-created test files

Never commit:
- Copyrighted movies, TV shows, commercial video clips
- Copyrighted music or audio
- Copyrighted images (stock photos, movie posters)
- Subtitle files extracted from commercial media (Netflix, Disney+)
- Any content without proper licensing or attribution

Before adding test fixtures/media, verify:
1. Content is public domain, permissively licensed, or self-created?
2. License permits open source redistribution?
3. Proper attribution included in comments?
4. No copyrighted characters, logos, trademarks?
5. Comfortable defending this in court?

If "no" to ANY question above, DO NOT add the file.

See contributing/copyright-compliance.md for detailed attribution requirements and current compliance status.

## Quick Commands

All make commands run from project root.

- `make quick-check` - Run after every change. Fast parallel compile check (Dart+Kotlin+Swift). MUST run from root
- `/pr-ready` - Full PR readiness check (tests, coverage, analysis)
- `/tdd FeatureName` - Start TDD cycle for a new feature
- `/coverage` - Show test coverage report for all packages
- `/test-native [platform]` - Run native tests (ios, android, macos, or all)
- `/fix` - Auto-fix code issues (format + dart fix + analyze)
- `/e2e [platform]` - Run E2E UI tests on device/simulator
- `/review [files]` - Review code for quality, bugs, test coverage

Subagents (via Task tool):
- `code-reviewer` - Reviews code for bugs, security, test coverage, platform consistency
- `security-auditor` - Scans for security vulnerabilities
- `doc-checker` - Scans for missing dartdoc on public APIs
- `test-gap-finder` - Identifies untested public methods and coverage gaps
- `doc-sync-checker` - Verifies markdown docs and dartdoc match implementation

Keep subagent list in sync with `.claude/agents/`.

## Project Priorities

1. Functional & Bug-Free - Reliability paramount. Must work correctly across all platforms
2. Simple & Easy to Use - Intuitive API, minimal integration effort
3. Well-Tested - Comprehensive coverage ensures stability
4. Well-Documented - All public APIs must have dartdoc

## Code Philosophy

Core Principles:
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** - CRITICAL principle. Never duplicate code. Extract to functions, shared modules, or generated code. Examples: makefiles use functions to generate 48 targets from 6 templates; iOS/macOS share Swift via CocoaPods; Android/iOS/macOS share MethodChannelBase pattern. If you write similar code twice, refactor it.
- Short, focused code - Prefer concise over verbose
- Consistent patterns - Same approach for similar problems
- Single responsibility - Each class/function does one thing well
- Share code - Avoid duplication across packages/platforms (iOS/macOS share Swift, MethodChannelBase pattern)
- Dart-first - Implement in Dart when possible without 3rd party deps; only use native for platform APIs
- Design for testing - Dependency injection, interfaces, mockable components
- Library independence - Library packages MUST be completely self-sufficient and NEVER reference example app code, classes, resources, or package names under ANY circumstance. Library must work standalone without example apps present.

Shared Apple Sources (iOS/macOS): Swift code shared via `shared_apple_sources/` directory. CocoaPods automatically creates symlinks during `pod install` via the `prepare_command` in each podspec. No manual setup required - symlinks are created automatically when building iOS/macOS apps.

See contributing/architecture.md for details on code sharing, state management patterns, refactoring guidelines.

## API Design Philosophy

Inspired by video_player Flutter library: API should feel familiar to existing video_player users while providing enhanced functionality. Design principles:
- Maintain compatible naming conventions - Method/property names should match video_player patterns where functionality overlaps (e.g., `initialize()`, `play()`, `pause()`, `seekTo()`, `setVolume()`, `value`, `position`, `duration`, `isPlaying`)
- Compatible even when extended - New/incompatible APIs should still feel like natural extensions of video_player patterns rather than completely different paradigms
- Smooth migration path - Users migrating from video_player should find API intuitive with minimal learning curve
- Preserve Flutter ecosystem familiarity - Follow established Flutter plugin conventions that video_player exemplifies

Reference implementation: https://pub.dev/packages/video_player

Note: See ROADMAP.md for high priority API refactoring task to align current implementation with this philosophy.

Coverage Targets:
- Dart code: 95% line coverage per file (target)
- Native code: 80% line coverage (target)
- Global minimum: 80% line coverage overall (mandatory)

Code Duplication:
- Threshold: ≤2.5% code duplication (mandatory)
- Detected duplication should be refactored when feasible
- Use shared base classes, utilities, or helper functions
- Checked automatically via `make quick-check` using jscpd
- Detection thresholds: min 10 lines, min 50 tokens

Documentation:
- All public APIs documented - Every public class, method, property needs dartdoc (`///`)
- README completeness - Document main usage scenarios and features requiring extra configuration

See contributing/developer-guide.md for API documentation requirements, developer configurability options, file creation policies.

## Project Structure

Federated Flutter plugin:

```
pro_video_player/
├── pro_video_player/                    # Main package (user-facing API)
├── pro_video_player_platform_interface/ # Abstract interfaces, DTOs, method_channel_base.dart
├── pro_video_player_android/            # ExoPlayer implementation
├── pro_video_player_ios/                # AVPlayer (extends MethodChannelBase)
├── pro_video_player_web/                # HTML5 VideoElement
├── pro_video_player_macos/              # AVPlayer (extends MethodChannelBase)
├── pro_video_player_windows/            # libmpv (requires Windows VM)
├── pro_video_player_linux/              # libmpv (requires Linux VM)
├── example-showcase/                         # Full-featured demo app
└── example-simple-player/                    # Minimal file/URL player
```

Key Features: Native video player per platform, Background playback, PiP, Fullscreen, Subtitles (SRT/VTT/SSA/ASS/TTML/CEA-608/708/embedded), Track selection, Adaptive streaming (HLS/DASH), Playlists (M3U/PLS/XSPF), Cross-platform Flutter controls.

Example apps: example-showcase must showcase ALL library features; example-simple-player is minimal file/URL player.

## Dependency Philosophy

Minimize external dependencies: Only add when absolutely necessary. Prefer native Dart/Flutter solutions. Keep dependency tree shallow.

Allowed: plugin_platform_interface (required for federated plugin), flutter_test/integration_test (testing), mocktail (mocking).

Avoided: Heavy utility packages, large dependency trees, unmaintained packages.

## Test-Driven Development

Strict TDD practices:
1. Write tests first - failing tests before implementation
2. Red → Green → Refactor cycle
3. Test categories: unit (mocked deps), widget, integration, platform channel

CRITICAL: Before writing ANY tests, consult contributing/testing-guide.md for established patterns, mock setup, async delays, common pitfalls, and helper functions. Do NOT reinvent solutions - use documented patterns.

CRITICAL: Do NOT skip tests without explicit user permission.

All tests must run and pass. If test failing:
1. Fix the test or code to make it pass
2. If skipping truly necessary (e.g., platform limitations), ask user first
3. Document why skip is necessary when approved

When Tests Fail: Failing tests often reveal implementation bugs, not test bugs - this is exactly what tests should do! Before assuming test is wrong, thoroughly examine implementation code it's testing. Example bugs caught: missing state updates, incomplete logic, forgotten cleanup. Fix root causes - If implementation incomplete, fix it; don't adjust tests to match broken behavior.

Testing Commands:
- `make test` - All Dart tests
- `make test-interface` - platform_interface only
- `make test-main` - main package only
- `make test-web` - web package (Chrome)
- `make test-e2e` - E2E UI tests (auto-detect)
- `make test-native` - All native tests
- `make coverage` - Full Dart + Native coverage with summary

Comprehensive testing guidance in contributing/testing-guide.md: test structure patterns (mock setup, widget testing, async delays), common pitfalls, E2E cross-platform guidelines, Android native coverage (unit vs instrumented vs combined), helper functions.

CRITICAL: When you discover and fix architectural testing challenges (e.g., desktop wrapper intercepting taps, timer cleanup issues, event stream broadcasting, async timing problems), you MUST document the solution in contributing/testing-guide.md. Add it to the appropriate section: "Test Structure Patterns", "Common Test Pitfalls", or create a new section if needed. Include the problem description, root cause, and solution with code examples. This prevents future developers from having to rediscover the same solutions.

## Verbose Logging Requirements

All logging in library code must be guarded by verbose mode. Prevents debug output from polluting production apps.

Logging functions:
- Kotlin: ProVideoPlayerPlugin.verboseLog(message, tag) - checks isVerboseLoggingEnabled
- Swift: verboseLog(message, tag:) - checks VerboseLogger.shared.isEnabled
- Dart: ProVideoPlayerLogger.log(message, tag:) - checks isVerboseLoggingEnabled
- Web: verboseLog(message, tag:) - checks isVerboseLoggingEnabled

Forbidden in library code:
- Kotlin: Log.d(), Log.e(), Log.w(), Log.i(), Log.v(), println()
- Swift: print(), NSLog()
- Dart: print(), debugPrint() (except in logger implementation)
- Web: console.log(), console.warn(), console.error()

Exception: Example app can use direct logging for demo/debug purposes.

`make quick-check` automatically verifies this. Manual check: `./makefiles/scripts/check-verbose-logging.sh`

## Code Style

Follows Effective Dart (https://dart.dev/effective-dart):
- Line length: 120 characters
- Prefer single quotes
- Relative imports within packages
- Always declare return types
- Document all public APIs
- Use flutter_lints

Commands: `dart format . -l 120`, `dart analyze`, `dart fix --apply`

Shared analysis_options.yaml at root. Excluded: *.g.dart, *.freezed.dart, *.mocks.dart

Lint Ignore Lines: CRITICAL - Do NOT add lint ignore lines (`// ignore:`, `// ignore_for_file:`) without explicit user permission. All code should pass strict analysis. If analyzer raises issue: 1) Fix underlying problem first, 2) If fix not possible/appropriate, ask user before adding ignore, 3) Document why ignore necessary when approved. Existing ignores are for specific cases (deprecated API migrations, legitimate async BuildContext patterns). New ignores require justification.

## Platform Priority

- Primary (equal): iOS, Android, macOS, Web - feature parity, sync implementations
- Secondary: Windows, Linux - defer until primary complete

See contributing/platform-notes.md for platform-specific details (iOS/macOS shared Swift, Windows/Linux shared C++, platform capabilities).

## Build Commands

- `make` - Interactive fzf task selector
- `make setup` - FVM + install dependencies + git hooks
- `make install` - Dependencies only
- `make clean` - Clean all packages
- `make run` - Run example app
- `make all` - Full rebuild with checks
- `make help` - All commands

## FVM

```bash
dart pub global activate fvm
fvm install
fvm flutter pub get
fvm flutter test
```

Flutter version in .fvmrc. Always prefix commands with fvm.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Ensure all tests pass
- Include tests for new functionality (TDD)
- Update documentation if needed
- Follow conventional commit messages

## Task Tracking with ROADMAP.md

ROADMAP.md is the single source of truth for tracking all tasks: future, current (in progress), and completed.

CRITICAL: When working on any task from the roadmap:

1. **Starting a task**: Move the entire task from its current section to "In Progress" section
2. **During work**: Tick checkboxes for each completed step immediately as you finish them (don't batch updates)
3. **Before completing**: Verify ALL criteria in contributing/task-completion-checklist.md are met
4. **After all steps complete**: Move task to "Completed" section with condensed summary
   - Remove implementation details, test coverage numbers, sub-bullet explanations
   - Keep only "what was accomplished" without "how it was implemented"
   - Pending tasks should remain detailed; completed tasks should be concise
   - Details preserved in git history and documentation if needed later

Always keep ROADMAP.md synchronized with your actual progress - it's the primary way to track what's done, what's in flight, and what's coming next.

## Documentation Structure

This project separates user documentation from developer/contributor documentation.

User Documentation (docs/): Help library users integrate and use the video player. Linked from README.md. Audience: App developers using this library.

```
