- Shared EventParser eliminates duplication
- MethodChannelBase deprecated for Windows/Linux

### Platform Capabilities Async Migration & Legacy Code Cleanup
- **Rationale:** Some platform capability checks were slow (synchronous), preventing app slowdowns required splitting into individual async methods
- **Implementation:**
  - Replaced bulk `getPlatformCapabilities()` with 21 individual async methods (e.g., `supportsPictureInPicture()`, `supportsFullscreen()`, etc.)
  - Created new `getPlatformInfo()` for static platform metadata (platformName, nativePlayerType, additionalInfo)
  - Updated all platform implementations (Android, iOS/macOS, Web, Windows, Linux)
  - Removed legacy `PlatformCapabilities` class entirely (library not yet published, no backward compatibility needed)
  - **Legacy Code Cleanup:** Removed all remaining legacy MethodChannel handlers across platforms:
    - Android: Deleted 45 unused handler methods (745 lines removed, ~75% reduction from 984 → 239 lines)
    - iOS/macOS: Already clean from previous migration (minimal stubs for test compatibility)
    - Windows: Removed legacy C++ MethodChannel handler (59 lines removed, ~68% reduction from 87 → 28 lines)
    - Linux: Removed legacy C MethodChannel handler (75 lines removed, ~69% reduction from 109 → 34 lines)
  - Total legacy code eliminated: ~975 lines across all platforms
- **Benefits:**
  - Async capability checks prevent blocking UI
  - Consistent async API across all 21 capabilities
  - Platform information separated from capability checks
  - All legacy MethodChannel code removed (Android, Windows, Linux now stub-only placeholders)
  - Clean codebase ready for future implementation (Windows/Linux)
- **Status:** Complete (2025-12-18) - All tests passing, all compilation checks passing

<details>
<summary><strong>Migrate high-value tests to standardized architecture (Phase 2)</strong></summary>

- **Rationale:** Migrate tests with highest duplication to use the new standardized testing infrastructure
- **Scope:** 20/67 test files (30%) - highest-value targets with most duplicate patterns
- **Implementation approach:**
  - [x] Identify highest-duplication test files (Duration.zero waits, manual verify calls, initialization patterns)
  - [x] Migrate Batch 1: 3 unit tests with most patterns (events, network, playback)
  - [x] Migrate Batch 2: 6 unit tests with moderate patterns (metadata, subtitles, error recovery, tracks, fullscreen, settings)
  - [x] Migrate Batch 3: 3 unit tests with remaining patterns (core, compatibility, playlist)
  - [x] Migrate Batch 4: 8 widget tests with event patterns (player widget, controls controller, interactions, playback, rendering, settings, gestures, theme)
  - [x] Verify all tests pass after each batch (100% pass rate maintained)
  - [x] Track progress and measure code elimination
- **Success Metrics:**
  - ✅ Test code duplication: **2.5%** (maintained threshold)
  - ✅ 20 files migrated using new helpers (30% of test suite)
  - ✅ ~95 lines of duplicate code eliminated
  - ✅ All 1220 tests passing (100% pass rate)
- **Code Eliminated:**
  - ~60 instances of `await Future<void>.delayed(Duration.zero)` → `await fixture.waitForEvents()`
  - ~80 instances of `fixture.eventController.add(event)` → `fixture.emitEvent(event)`
  - ~15 manual `verify(() => fixture.mockPlatform.xxx())` calls → verification helpers
  - ~20 lines of initialization code → `fixture.initializeWithDefaultSource()`
  - 1 unused import removed
- **Files Migrated:** 20 high-value files (3 + 6 + 3 + 8 across 4 batches)
- **Remaining Opportunity:** 47 files (70%) with low duplication (0-2 patterns per file) available for incremental migration as files are modified
- **Note:** Architecture is complete - all common patterns (appearing in 5+ files) have been extracted to shared infrastructure

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Memory leak tracking in tests (Phase 3)</strong></summary>

- **Rationale:** Video players manage native resources (players, textures, streams) that can leak if not properly disposed. Enable Flutter's built-in leak tracking to catch these automatically.
- **Scope:** **All packages** - Complete coverage across entire project
- **Implementation Status:**
  - [x] Research Flutter leak tracking API and implementation patterns
  - [x] Add `leak_tracker_flutter_testing` dependency to all packages

  - [x] Verify leak detection works correctly (confirmed with intentional leak test)
  - [x] Run baseline scan on all tests
  - [x] Document leak tracking patterns in contributing/testing-guide.md
  - [x] Fix 20 detected leaks (19 ProVideoPlayerController + 1 ValueNotifier)
  - [x] Establish clean baseline (0 unresolved leaks)
  - [x] Enable leak tracking in all Dart test packages (main, platform_interface, iOS, macOS, Android, web)
  - [x] Add to CI pipeline (N/A - not using CI currently)
- **Final Status (2025-12-16):**
  - **Packages with leak tracking:** 6/6 (100%)

<summary><strong>E2E Testing Infrastructure (2025-12-17)</strong></summary>

- **Goal:** Create reusable E2E testing infrastructure with shared constants, helpers, and fixtures
- **Scope:** Refactored both E2E test files (e2e_ui_test.dart, player_integration_test.dart) to use centralized infrastructure
- **Infrastructure Created:**
  - Shared constants (E2EDelays, E2EPlatform, E2ERetry, E2ETestMedia, E2EViewport)
  - Helper functions (wait, tap, time parsing, navigation, platform detection)
  - E2E test fixtures (setup/teardown, timing, logging)
- **Improvements:**
  - e2e_ui_test.dart: 1,798 → 1,488 lines (17.2% reduction)
  - player_integration_test.dart: Fixed critical web/macOS hang issue (16 pumpAndSettle calls replaced)
  - Eliminated all hardcoded delays and manual retry loops
  - Platform-aware timing and settling
- **Parallel E2E Execution:**
  - `make test-e2e` runs all platforms (iOS, Android, macOS, Web) simultaneously
  - 4x faster (5-10 min vs 20-40 min sequential)
  - Separate log files per platform, structured summary table
  - `make test-e2e-sequential` available as fallback
- **Benefits:**
  - Reliable cross-platform E2E testing with consistent patterns
  - New E2E tests can be written in <15 minutes using templates
  - Comprehensive documentation in contributing/testing-guide.md

<summary><strong>Architectural Improvements - Picker Dialog Investigation (2025-12-17)</strong></summary>

- **Goal:** Evaluate further abstraction of picker dialog patterns
- **Outcome:** No implementation needed - current architecture already optimal
- **Investigation Findings:**
  - Analyzed all 7 picker dialogs (Speed, Quality, Subtitle, Audio, ScalingMode, Chapters, OrientationLock)
  - `BasePickerDialog<T>` (124 lines) already provides excellent generic abstraction
  - Individual dialogs (53-65 lines each) contain legitimate domain-specific logic, not duplication
  - Code duplication at 0.84% (well below 2.5% threshold)
  - Further abstraction would require 6+ callback functions, reducing clarity for minimal benefit (~20-45 lines saved)
- **Time Saved:** ~2-3 weeks of unnecessary refactoring work avoided
- **Documentation:** Investigation findings archived in ROADMAP.md for future reference

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Architectural Improvements - Streaming Manager Base Class (2025-12-17)</strong></summary>

  - Created `StreamingManager` abstract base class (153 lines)
  - Refactored HlsManager: 268 → 237 lines (11.6% reduction)
  - Refactored DashManager: 332 → 306 lines (7.8% reduction)
- **Shared Infrastructure:**
  - Common fields: eventEmitter, videoElement, _player, _availableQualities, _isInitialized
  - Protected helpers: markInitialized(), updateAvailableQualities(), clearAvailableQualities()
  - Template method pattern for disposal lifecycle
- **Benefits Achieved:**
  - Eliminated 57 lines of duplicated boilerplate
  - Consistent streaming manager interface
  - Easier to add new formats (e.g., Smooth Streaming)

## Planned (High Priority) 🔥

<details>
<summary><strong>Multi-Browser Test Execution (Parallel)</strong></summary>

- [ ] **Multi-Browser Test Execution (Parallel)**
  - **Rationale:** Web package tests currently run only on Chrome. Need to verify cross-browser compatibility across Firefox, Safari, and Edge to catch browser-specific issues early.
  - **Scope:** `pro_video_player_web/test/` directory (all test files)
  - **Current Status:** Tests working on Chrome after fixing battery_interop.dart JS interop issue
  - **Test Results:** 67 helper tests passing, 191/221 manager tests passing on Chrome
  - **Implementation:**
    - [x] Create parallel test runner script/makefile target (`make test-web-all` ✅)
    - [ ] Configure test execution for Chrome, Firefox, Safari (macOS), Edge
    - [ ] Run all browsers in parallel for faster CI/CD
    - [ ] Add browser-specific test result reporting
    - [ ] Document any browser-specific compatibility issues found
    - [ ] Add to CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
  - **Supported Browsers:**
    - Chrome (default, working ✅)
    - Firefox (`--platform firefox`)
    - Safari macOS only (`--platform safari`)
    - Edge (`--platform edge`)
  - **Expected Outcome:** All web tests passing across all 4 browsers, parallel execution reducing test time

<details>
<summary><strong>ProVideoPlayerController Refactoring - Domain Split</strong></summary>

- [ ] **ProVideoPlayerController.dart refactoring** (1,525 lines → target: ~600-800 lines)
  - **Rationale:** God object managing 15 managers with 100+ public methods, exceeds file size guideline by 52%
  - **Current Issues:**
    - Complex initialization with 13 callback parameters in coordinators
    - Tight coupling to all feature domains (playback, tracks, PiP, casting, playlists, etc.)
    - Massive public API surface makes it hard to understand and maintain
    - Deep constructor parameter lists (10-15 parameters common)
  - **Implementation Approach:**
    - [ ] Phase 1: Extract `PlaybackController` (play, pause, seek, volume, speed, loop)
    - [ ] Phase 2: Extract `MediaController` (audio tracks, subtitles, quality, chapters)
    - [ ] Phase 3: Extract `AdvancedFeaturesController` (PiP, fullscreen, casting)
    - [ ] Phase 4: Extract `PlaylistController` (playlist navigation, shuffle, repeat)
    - [ ] Phase 5: Extract `ErrorRecoveryController` (retry logic, network resilience)
    - [ ] Phase 6: Update `ProVideoPlayerController` to compose extracted controllers
    - [ ] Phase 7: Create facade API that delegates to domain controllers
    - [ ] Phase 8: Update all tests to work with new structure
    - [ ] Phase 9: Update documentation and migration guide
  - **Target Structure:**
    ```
    ProVideoPlayerController (core facade, ~400 lines)
    ├─ PlaybackController (~250 lines, 20-25 methods)
    ├─ MediaController (~300 lines, 25-30 methods)
    ├─ AdvancedFeaturesController (~200 lines, 15-20 methods)
    ├─ PlaylistController (~200 lines, 15-20 methods)
    └─ ErrorRecoveryController (~150 lines, 10-15 methods)
    ```
  - **Benefits:**
    - Each controller <400 lines with focused responsibility
    - Reduced API surface per controller (easier to learn and use)
    - Users can import only what they need
    - Improved testability with smaller scope
    - Follows manager pattern successfully used in web package
    - Easier onboarding for new contributors
  - **Testing Requirements:**
    - All existing 131+ tests must continue passing
    - Add focused test suites for each domain controller
    - Maintain 95%+ line coverage target
  - **Pattern Reference:** Follow web_video_player.dart refactoring (1,981→682 lines, 65% reduction)

<summary><strong>VideoControlsController Refactoring - Extract Handlers</strong></summary>

- [ ] **VideoControlsController.dart refactoring** (894 lines → target: ~400-500 lines)
  - **Rationale:** Approaches 1,000-line guideline, mixed responsibilities across UI state, input handling, and dialog management
  - **Current Issues:**
    - Handles: state management, keyboard shortcuts, context menus, dialogs, timers, mouse tracking
    - Difficult to test input handlers in isolation (requires widget tests instead of unit tests)
    - Complex conditional logic across multiple concerns
  - **Implementation Approach:**
    - [ ] Phase 1: Extract `KeyboardShortcutHandler` (keyboard events, media keys, shortcut map)
      - Handle all keyboard input logic
      - Map keys to actions (space, arrows, M, F, Shift+arrows)
      - Support mobile keyboard and media keys
      - Unit testable without widget context
    - [ ] Phase 2: Extract `DialogCoordinator` (all picker dialogs)
      - Centralize: speed picker, quality picker, subtitle picker, chapter picker, audio picker
      - Reduce dialog management duplication
      - Common dialog presentation logic
    - [ ] Phase 3: Extract `ContextMenuBuilder` (right-click menu)
      - Build menu items based on player state
      - Separate menu structure from state management
    - [ ] Phase 4: Update `VideoControlsController` (keep core state)
      - Auto-hide timer logic
      - Controls visibility state
      - Latest volume/brightness tracking
      - Coordinate between extracted handlers
    - [ ] Phase 5: Update tests for new structure
    - [ ] Phase 6: Verify all 120 control tests still passing
  - **Target Structure:**

<summary><strong>VideoPlayerControls Widget Refactoring - Extract Routing & Layout</strong></summary>

- [ ] **VideoPlayerControls.dart refactoring** (846 lines → target: ~400-500 lines)
  - **Rationale:** Exceeds guideline, complex widget handling layout selection, gesture wrapping, fullscreen navigation
  - **Current Issues:**
    - Mixed concerns: layout selection, gesture wrapping, fullscreen routing, subtitle rendering
    - Complex conditional rendering logic
    - Difficult to test routing logic in isolation
  - **Implementation Approach:**
    - [ ] Phase 1: Extract `FullscreenNavigator` (routing logic)
      - Handle fullscreen route pushing/popping
      - Build fullscreen route with proper configuration
      - Manage navigation state transitions
      - Testable without full widget tree
    - [ ] Phase 2: Extract `ControlsLayoutBuilder` (layout selection)
      - Determine desktop vs mobile vs compact
      - Build appropriate layout for configuration
      - Centralize layout decision logic
    - [ ] Phase 3: Extract `GestureWrapperFactory` (wrapper selection)
      - Create appropriate gesture wrapper based on platform
      - Desktop vs mobile gesture handling
      - Configurable gesture enable/disable
    - [ ] Phase 4: Simplify `VideoPlayerControls` (composition)
      - Focus on widget composition
      - Delegate to extracted classes
      - Reduce conditional logic
    - [ ] Phase 5: Update tests for new structure
  - **Target Structure:**
    ```
    VideoPlayerControls (~400 lines - composition)
    ├─ FullscreenNavigator (~150 lines - routing)
    ├─ ControlsLayoutBuilder (~200 lines - layout logic)
    └─ GestureWrapperFactory (~100 lines - wrapper selection)
    ```
  - **Benefits:**
    - Fullscreen navigation testable with unit tests
    - Layout logic can be unit tested with different configurations
    - Widget focuses on composition, not conditional logic
    - Easier to add new layouts or gesture modes
    - Clearer separation of concerns
  - **Testing Requirements:**
    - All existing widget tests must continue passing
    - Add unit tests for navigation and layout logic
    - Maintain test coverage levels

<summary><strong>Dependency Injection Container - Service Locator Pattern</strong></summary>

- [ ] **Introduce Dependency Injection Container**
  - **Rationale:** Reduce complexity of manual dependency wiring (13 callback parameters in InitializationCoordinator)
  - **Current Pain Points:**
    - Deep constructor parameter lists (10-15 parameters common)
    - Manual dependency graph management
    - Circular dependency wiring complexity
    - Difficult to test with different configurations
  - **Implementation Approach:**
    - [ ] Phase 1: Create `ControllerServices` container class
      - Encapsulate all manager instances
      - Factory methods for common configurations
      - Internal dependency wiring (hidden from users)
    - [ ] Phase 2: Update `ProVideoPlayerController` to use services
      - Accept `ControllerServices` in constructor
      - Simplify initialization code
      - Reduce callback parameter count
    - [ ] Phase 3: Create test fixture helpers
      - Mock service configurations
      - Easy test setup with different dependencies
    - [ ] Phase 4: Update all controller tests
    - [ ] Phase 5: Update documentation with new pattern
  - **Implementation Pattern:**
    ```dart
    // Simple service locator pattern (no external dependencies)
    class ControllerServices {
      final PlaybackManager playback;
      final TrackManager tracks;
      final SubtitleManager subtitles;
      final PipManager pip;
      // ... other managers

      // Factory for common configurations
      factory ControllerServices.create({
        required ProVideoPlayerPlatform platform,
        required int playerId,
        VideoPlayerOptions? options,
      }) {
        // Wire up dependencies internally
        final playback = PlaybackManager(...);
        final tracks = TrackManager(...);
        // ... dependency graph construction
        return ControllerServices._internal(
          playback: playback,
          tracks: tracks,
          ...
        );
      }

      ControllerServices._internal({...});
    }

    // Simplified controller constructor
    ProVideoPlayerController({
      required ControllerServices services,
    }) {
      _playback = services.playback;
      _tracks = services.tracks;
      // No complex wiring needed
    }
    ```
  - **Benefits:**
    - Reduced constructor complexity (1 parameter vs 15)
    - Centralized dependency wiring (easier to maintain)
    - Easier to test with mock services
    - Maintains "no external dependencies" principle (uses only Dart)
    - Follows dependency injection best practices
    - Makes controller initialization code much cleaner
  - **Testing Requirements:**
    - Create `MockControllerServices` test fixture
    - Update all controller tests to use service pattern
    - Verify no regression in functionality
  - **Note:** Prerequisite for ProVideoPlayerController domain split (simplifies extracted controller construction)

<summary><strong>Complete Pigeon Migration - Eliminate Bridge Layer</strong></summary>

- [ ] **Complete Pigeon Migration (Phases 7-9)**
  - **Rationale:** Current Pigeon implementation is a temporary bridge that defeats the purpose of type-safe communication by manually converting Pigeon types back to `[String: Any]` dictionaries
  - **Current Architecture (Bridge Layer - Anti-Pattern):**
    ```swift
    // PigeonHostApiHandler receives type-safe Pigeon calls
    func setSubtitleTrack(playerId: Int64, track: SubtitleTrackMessage?, ...) {
        // Manually degrades to untyped dictionaries
        args["track"] = [
            "id": track.id,
            "label": track.label as Any,  // ← Code smell: need `as Any` casts
            "language": track.language as Any,
            "isDefault": track.isDefault as Any
        ]
        // Wraps in old-style FlutterMethodCall
        let call = FlutterMethodCall(methodName: "setSubtitleTrack", arguments: args)
        sharedBase.handle(call) { result in ... }
    }
    ```
  - **Target Architecture (Pure Pigeon - Proper Pattern):**
    ```swift
    // SharedPluginBase implements Pigeon protocol DIRECTLY
    class SharedPluginBase: ProVideoPlayerHostApi {
        func setSubtitleTrack(playerId: Int64, track: SubtitleTrackMessage?, ...) {
            // Work directly with type-safe Pigeon objects
            // NO dictionary conversion needed!
            videoPlayer.selectSubtitleTrack(trackId: track?.id)
        }
    }
    ```
  - **Implementation Phases:**
    - [ ] **Phase 7:** Update main package to use Pigeon-based platform implementations
      - Migrate `pro_video_player` package to call Pigeon APIs directly
      - Update `ProVideoPlayerController` to use `ProVideoPlayerHostApi` instead of MethodChannel
      - Remove legacy Map-based API calls from main package
      - Update all tests to work with new Pigeon-based communication
    - [ ] **Phase 8:** Deprecate and remove old MethodChannelBase
      - Remove `PigeonHostApiHandler` bridge classes (iOS/macOS/Android)
      - Make `SharedPluginBase` and platform implementations directly implement `ProVideoPlayerHostApi`
      - Eliminate all `[String: Any]` dictionary conversions
      - Remove legacy `FlutterMethodCall` handling code
      - Update Windows/Linux to use Pigeon (currently still using MethodChannelBase)
    - [ ] **Phase 9:** Event streaming migration to FlutterApi callbacks
      - Replace EventChannel with Pigeon `@FlutterApi` callbacks
      - Implement `ProVideoPlayerFlutterApi` for native → Dart events
      - Type-safe event messages (no more Map-based events)
      - Update event listeners in main package
      - Remove legacy EventChannel infrastructure
  - **Benefits:**
    - **True type safety:** Compile-time checking for all platform communication
    - **Eliminate code smell:** No more `as Any` casts for optional values
    - **Reduced code:** Remove entire bridge layer (~838 lines in Android, ~600 lines in iOS/macOS)
    - **Better errors:** Type mismatches caught at compile time, not runtime
    - **Improved maintainability:** Single source of truth for API definitions
    - **Consistent patterns:** Same type-safe approach across all platforms
  - **Code Elimination:**
    - Remove `PigeonHostApiHandler.kt` (838 lines)
    - Remove `shared_apple_sources/PigeonHostApiHandler.swift` (600+ lines)
    - Remove dictionary conversion utilities (200+ lines across platforms)
    - Remove legacy MethodChannelBase from Windows/Linux after Pigeon migration
    - Total: ~2,000+ lines of bridge code eliminated
  - **Testing Requirements:**
    - All existing tests must continue passing
    - Add Pigeon-specific integration tests
    - Verify type safety with compilation checks
    - Test event streaming with FlutterApi callbacks
  - **References:**
    - See `pro_video_player_platform_interface/PIGEON_MIGRATION.md` for detailed architecture
    - See `contributing/pigeon-guide.md` for Pigeon configuration and troubleshooting
  - **Current Status:** Phases 1-6 complete (infrastructure, API definitions, native handlers)
  - **Priority:** HIGH - Current bridge layer defeats Pigeon's purpose and adds unnecessary complexity

<details>
<summary><strong>Pure Dart container header parser</strong></summary>

- [ ] Pure Dart container header parser:
  - [ ] Parse container file headers without native player (MP4, MKV, WebM, MOV, etc.)
  - [ ] Extract ALL available streams (multiple video/audio/subtitle tracks)
  - [ ] Per-stream metadata: codec, bitrate, language, resolution, channel layout
  - [ ] Stream positioning data: byte offsets, duration, sample tables
  - [ ] Extract codec strings and profiles (e.g., "hvc1.1.6.L93.B0", "vp09.00.41.08", "av01")
  - [ ] No external dependencies (Dart-first approach using ByteData/Uint8List)
  - [ ] Benefits over current VideoMetadata:
    - Platform-independent (works on web without native APIs)
    - Reveals all tracks (current implementation only shows single video/audio codec)
    - No player initialization required (inspect before playback)
    - Foundation for remuxing (need stream positions for segmentation)
  - [ ] Implementation phases:
    - [ ] Phase 1: MP4/MOV parser (ISO base media file format - box/atom structure)
    - [ ] Phase 2: MKV/WebM parser (EBML/Matroska specification)
    - [ ] Phase 3: Additional formats as needed
  - [ ] Codec compatibility testing integration:
    - [ ] Query native platform capabilities with extracted codec info
    - [ ] iOS/macOS: AVAssetTrack.isPlayable, AVPlayer.availableVideoCodecTypes
    - [ ] Android: MediaCodecList.findDecoderForFormat, RendererCapabilities
    - [ ] Web: MediaSource.isTypeSupported(), HTMLMediaElement.canPlayType()
    - [ ] Benefits:
      - Pre-flight compatibility checks before playback attempt
      - Intelligent fallback suggestions (alternative quality/format)
      - Helpful error messages ("Requires iOS 17+ for AV1" vs generic failure)
      - Platform/device-specific warnings (HEVC on Android, VP9 on iOS, DASH on Apple)
      - Trigger remuxing only when needed
  - [ ] Use cases: Pre-playback inspection, stream selection UI, remuxing preparation, format compatibility checks, codec capability testing
  - [ ] Note: Header parsing only (not video decoding), reasonable performance

<details>
<summary><strong>Advanced embedded subtitle extraction with full styling</strong></summary>

- [ ] Advanced embedded subtitle extraction with full styling:
  - [ ] Extract raw subtitle track data to preserve styling (before native player processing)
  - [ ] Parse embedded SSA/ASS, TTML formats in Dart to preserve styling
  - [ ] Full styling support for Flutter rendering mode (colors, fonts, positions, animations)
  - [ ] **Two different approaches based on source type:**
    - **Streaming (HLS/DASH) - Easier:**
      - [ ] Parse HLS m3u8 manifest to find subtitle track URLs
      - [ ] Parse DASH MPD manifest to find subtitle segments
      - [ ] Fetch subtitle files/segments directly (often WebVTT)
      - [ ] Bypass native player subtitle handling entirely
      - [ ] Benefit: Subtitles are already separate files in stream manifests
    - **Local files (MP4/MKV) - Complex:**
      - [ ] iOS/macOS: Use `AVAssetReader` to extract raw subtitle track data from container
      - [ ] Android: Custom ExoPlayer extractors or `MediaExtractor` API to demux
      - [ ] Web: Limited - may not be feasible due to browser API constraints
      - [ ] Requires: Container demuxing, track extraction
  - [ ] Benefits:
    - Preserve advanced SSA/ASS styling from embedded tracks (not just plain text)
    - Maintain TTML positioning and formatting metadata
    - **Works with both local files AND streaming content (HLS/DASH)**
    - Consistent with external subtitle file parsing approach
  - [ ] Current limitation: Native extraction only provides plain text cues, styling is lost
  - [ ] Note: Streaming implementation may be easier to start with (manifest parsing vs container demuxing)

<details>
<summary><strong>Golden Toolkit - Visual regression testing for UI controls</strong></summary>

- [ ] **Golden Toolkit - Visual regression testing**
  - **Rationale:** Catch visual regressions automatically in complex UI control layouts through screenshot comparison
  - **Benefits:**
    - Snapshot test control UI layouts (desktop vs mobile, themes, compact mode)
    - Automatically detect unintended visual changes (padding, sizing, positioning)
    - Test responsive layouts across multiple screen sizes in single test
    - Much faster than manual UI verification
    - Great for PR reviews - see visual diffs immediately
    - Prevent accidental control layout breakage during refactoring
  - **Use cases:**
    - VideoPlayerControls layout variations (desktop/mobile/compact)
    - Subtitle overlay positioning and styling
    - Button positioning and sizing across themes
    - Progress bar rendering states
    - Menu overlays and picker dialogs
    - Responsive breakpoint behavior
  - **Implementation approach:**
    - [ ] Add golden_toolkit as dev_dependency (~0.15.0)
    - [ ] Create golden tests for key control layouts
    - [ ] Start with high-value tests: DesktopVideoControls, MobileVideoControls
    - [ ] Add golden tests for subtitle overlay positioning
    - [ ] Test theme variations (light/dark) and compact mode
    - [ ] Configure CI to fail on visual regressions
    - [ ] Document golden test patterns in contributing/testing-guide.md
  - **Scope:** Focus on VideoPlayerControls and overlay components (~20-30 golden tests)
  - **Note:** Goldens need updating when UI intentionally changes. Pixel-perfect matching can be brittle on different platforms.

## Notes

- This roadmap is subject to change based on user feedback and project priorities
- Items are tracked from high to low priority
- Completed items are kept for historical reference
- **File Size Guideline**: Dart files should not exceed 1,000 lines. Large classes must be decoupled into smaller, focused components to remain short, maintainable, and testable. When a file approaches or exceeds this limit, refactor it by extracting components, controllers, or pure logic classes (see VideoPlayerControls refactoring as example)
